##OpenRISC based SoC

This is my academic main project. This SoC is basically a modification of MinSoC project. This repo contains board support for Diglient Nexys3 FPGA kit, which contains a Xilinx Spartan 6 Chip.

If you set the default options and build from this source, you will have an SoC with UART module which yells out "Hello World." when the reset button (mapped to the center button in the cluster of 5 microswitches in the kit)

### Its a work in progress!
